## Mattermost Issue Resolver Plugin

## Summary

The plugin helps to resolve issues directly through the Mattermost application. It enables the users to get solutions to their issues/questions if a similar/related question is found on [stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com). If a similar/related question is not found on stackoverflow, it suggests contacting a user who is skilled in the domain of the question/issue. To maintain the skills of the users (for the task of suggesting a skilled user for an issue), the plugin provides a method for each user to update his/her skills.
