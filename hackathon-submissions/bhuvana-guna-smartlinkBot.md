## Smart Links Manager Bot

### Idea

When you are on a project, oftentimes you come across various blogs, products, posts, etc that you would want to share with the team. You keep posting them in the channel. Now over time the channel would grow and will have a lot of content, that it becomes next to impossible to search for a particular article/post shared in the past. Say you want to find all the links shared related to a particular topic, there isn't a way for it now.

That is where this smart bot is going to help us. The bot will fetch the content from the link -> Processes it and understands what it is about (NLU) -> And saves it in its brain(DB) and trains itself(ML)

Now when you want to get the links related to a topic you can just ask the bot and it will fetch all the related bookmarked links.

The basic idea of developing this productivity bot is, to have the bot manage all the links or bookmarks for you. You can also use this bot as a personal bookmark manager, wherein you just keep sending just the links to the bot and bot classifies and categorizes for you. Won't that be handy!
