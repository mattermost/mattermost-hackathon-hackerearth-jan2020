# Linkbot

## Summary

* Linkbot aims to improve user workflow by organizing the links shared on Mattermost groups.
* This would enhance user experience, encourage knowledge sharing and increase productivity. 
* Linkbot silently listens to links posted on channels (it is a part of) and provides a unified view for quick access.
* Supports searching links for a specific time period and/or search via tags.
* Supports scheduling periodic aggregation of links (weekly/monthly) posted across channels in a team. 
* With additional [linkbot-plugin](https://github.com/shadabk96/mattermost-linkbot-plugin), linkbot provides a clean UI to access the knowledge shared.
