# Linkbot

## Summary

* Linkbot aims to improve user workflow by organizing the links shared on Mattermost groups.
* This would greatly enhance user experience, encouraging knowledge sharing and increasing productivity. 
* Linkbot silently listens to links posted on channels (it's present in) and provides a unified view for quick access.
* Supports search for a specific time period or search via tags.
* Supports scheduling periodic (weekly/monthly) aggregation of links shared. 
* With additional linkbot-plugin, linkbot provides a clean UI to access knowledge shared.
